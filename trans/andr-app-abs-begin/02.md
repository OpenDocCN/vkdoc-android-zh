# 2.设置 Android Studio 开发系统

Wallace Jackson<sup>1</sup>(1)Lompoc, California, USAThese days, you see Android operating system powered devices of every size and shape, everywhere you look. These can be worn on your person; used in home appliances; as a part of your car; or providing entertainment in your living room, taking the form of your iTV set, or a tablet, an e-book reader, or even an Android game console.During this chapter, you’ll learn how to assemble a 64-bit workstation that will allow you to develop applications for the Android 7 (and previous versions) operating system (OS). This will give you a high-level overview of the software requirements, the workstation hardware requirements , which open source programming language software development kits (SDK) and integrated development environment (IDE) you will need to download and install, where to download these and how to properly install them, and how to configure and update them as well.You will get all of the tedious Google searches and downloads out of the way regarding how to go about obtaining all of these professional open source software and content development packages, SDKs, IDEs, and related plug-in components, which together will form your comprehensive Android Studio 2.3 production workstation .Even though this is an “Absolute Beginners” Android title, I want to teach you how to put together a pro Android development workstation, so that you are all ready to get into the various Pro Android series of books from Apress (after you finish mastering this book, of course). So that everyone experiences this book equally, this chapter will outline all of the steps needed to obtain a completely decked-out Android 7.1.1 development workstation.

## 组装您的 Android 7 开发工作站

In this chapter, I will outline a detailed overview of what will be needed to put together a complete Android Studio development workstation, which you’ll be able to utilize throughout this book, and others, to create Android apps.The first thing that you will do is to download the entire Java SE 8 software development kit (SDK), which Oracle calls the JavaSE 8 JDK (Java Development Kit). Android Studio uses Java Standard Edition (SE) Version 8 update 121, as of Android Studio 2.3, as well as the IntelliJ 2016.3 IDEA.NoteJava 9 also exists, and is under a beta release, at Java 9 Build 156\. In the third quarter of 2017, there will be a Java Version 9 released, which will include powerful JavaFX 8.0 APIs that turn the Java programming language into a powerful new media engine. JavaFX 8.0 will also work in the 64-bit Android OS.The second thing that we will download and install is the Android Studio Development Toolset , which we will get from Google’s tools.android.com website. Android Studio is currently at Version 2.3 (Android 7.1.1), and Android 6 used Android Studio Version 2.1\. Android Studio currently consists of the IntelliJ 2016.3 IDEA along with the Android 25 APIs. These Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) bridge the Android 7.1.1 SDK with the IntelliJ IDEA, making them into one seamless Android 7 software development environment. It is important to note that IntelliJ can also be used for other types of non-Android application development as well, including HTML5, Java, JavaFX, and C++, among others.After your core Android development environment software is downloaded, you’ll then download and install external new media asset development tools , which you will utilize in conjunction with Android 7.1.1 to do things such as UI wireframing (Pencil), digital image editing (GIMP), digital audio editing (Audacity), digital video editing (Lightworks or DaVinci Resolve), 3D modeling and animation (Blender), digital illustration (Inkscape), visual effects (Fusion), and even running your Android development business (OpenOffice). Professional Android applications use more than just Android code, they use what I call “new media assets,” such as digital audio, digital images, digital video, 3D, and SVG, all of which you will learn to reference from Android using XML (eXtensible Markup Language).All of these software development tools, which you will be downloading and installing, will come close to matching all of the primary feature sets of the expensive paid software packages, such as those from Microsoft (Office and Visual Studio), Apple (Logic, Avid, Final Cut Pro), Autodesk (Maya, Flint, Smoke, Flame and 3D Studio Max), and Adobe (Photoshop CS, Premeire and After Effects).Each of these paid software packages would cost a couple thousand dollars each to purchase and maintain, so plan on paying ten thousand (your local currency unit here) to put together a similar paid software workstation to develop for the proprietary (closed) iOS or the Windows consumer electronics device platforms.Open source software is free to download, install, and even to upgrade, and is continually adding features and becoming more and more professional, each and every day. You’ll be completely amazed at how professional open source software packages have become over the last decade or so; if you have not experienced this already, you are about to, in a very significant way. I also have Digital New Media Fundamentals books on each of these new media software genres, in case you need to get up to speed on the basics of each genre of new media, and I also wrote an Android Studio New Media Fundamentals (Apress, 2015) title, covering all of them. You can even run your workstation on Ubuntu Linux 17.04 if you like!

### Android 开发工作站:硬件基础

Since during the chapter you will put together what will be the foundation for your Android applications development system for the duration of this book, let’s take a moment to discuss the Android development workstation’s hardware configuration, as that’s an important factor for your performance (speed of development), which is as important as the software itself.This section will therefore cover a plethora of important systems hardware considerations that you should consider when assembling your workstation.I recommend using at a bare minimum an Intel i7 hexa-core processor, or an AMD 64-bit octa-core processor, with at least 16GB of DDR3-1600 memory. I’m using the Octa-core AMD 8350 with 16GB of DDR3-2000, but I recently got an Octacore Intel i7 workstation for Android Studio 2.3 development. Intel also now has a deca-core i7 processor. This would be the equivalent of having 20 AMD cores, as each Intel core can host two threads, so even an i7 quad-core looks like 8 AMD cores to an OS thread-scheduler algorithm.AMD has a 16-core processor as well, which is usually deployed inside of server architectures, but this CPU can be used in a client-side Android development workstation, which would greatly speed video compression or 3D rendering for your Android applications development.There are also high-speed DDR3 1866, and DDR4 2400 clockspeed memory module components available. A high number signifies faster memory access speed. To calculate the actual megahertz speed at which memory is cycling, divide the number by 4 (1333=333Mhz, 1600=400Mhz, 1866=466Mhz, 2400=600Mhz clock rate). Memory access speed is the key workstation performance factor because your processor is usually “bottle-necked” by the speed at which the processor cores can access the data (in memory) that they need to process.With all this high-speed processing and memory access going on inside your workstation while it is operating, it is also important to keep everything cool so that you do not experience “thermal problems.” I recommend using a wide full-tower enclosure, with 120mm or 230mm cooling fans (one or two at least), as well as a captive liquid induction cooling fan on the CPU. This type of CPU cooler has cooling tubes filled with water that touch the CPU and draw away heat, turning the water into steam, which rises up the tubes to the cooling fan, which cools this steam, condensing it back into water, which runs back down the pipe to cool the CPU. It’s important to note that the cooler your system runs, the longer it lasts, and the faster it runs, which is important for Android 7 application development.If you really want the maximum performance, especially while emulating Android Virtual Devices (AVDs), which are used for app prototyping or testing, which you will learn about in the next chapter, you’ll want to make sure that your Android development workstation has a solid state disk (SSD) hard drive as its primary (C:\ “boot” drive) disk drive, from which your applications and OS software will launch.You can always use more affordable hard disk drive (HDD) hardware for your D:\ (secondary) hard disk drive, for your data storage, which does not need the speed of operation as it is just used for long-term storage.For my OS, I’m using 64-bit Windows 10 OS, which is not very memory efficient, for this book since it is very commonly found on computers. Linux 64-bit OSes are also extremely memory efficient; a good example of this is Ubuntu Mate 17.04 which uses around 350MB of system memory. It’s important to note that Windows 10 comes on most quad-core workstations in retail stores such as Walmart and Staples, and with an OS price of several hundred dollars if purchased separately, you could look at the hardware as essentially being free. That said, Ubuntu 17.04 running on Intel i7 will be an order of magnitude faster for development, especially emulation of Android devices.

### Android 开发工作站:软件基础

To create a well-rounded Android applications development workstation, you will be installing content development open source software, after you install Java SE 8u121, IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3, and the Android Studio 2.3 application development environment. These are all open source programming packages, and therefore we will be assembling a 100% open source workstation for your company, with the exception of the Windows 10 OS. If you use Ubuntu 17.04 your workstation would be 100% open source and free.For those readers who have just purchased their new Android workstations, and who are going to put their Android development software suite together completely from scratch, I’ll go through an entire work process throughout the rest of this chapter, starting with Java SE 8u121, as it is the foundation for IntelliJ IDEA 2016 as well as for Android Studio. After that, you will acquire the Android Studio 2.3 (Android 7.1.1 and IntelliJ 2016 Bundle). Finally, we’ll search for, and download, your new media content development software, including digital imaging, digital audio, digital video, 3D animation, and visual effects, all of which will be used with Android Studio. We will even acquire a complete business software suite called Open Office 4.2, originally created by Sun Microsystems, and acquired, and made open source, by Oracle, who also owns the OpenJDK and Java 8 programming language.

## Java 8:下载并安装 Android 基础

Before you run a Java SE installation , you should remove any older versions of Java SE using your Windows Control Panel, via the Add or Remove Programs (XP or Vista), or Programs and Features (Windows 7, 8 or 10) utility. To remove an older version of the Java JDK or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) select them and right-click on the selected entry and use the “Uninstall/Remove” option to uninstall.This will be necessary especially if your workstation is not brand new, so that only your latest Java SE 8u121 and JRE 8u121 are the sole Java versions that are currently installed on your new Android development workstation.To install a new JDK:

1.  1。你要做的第一件事就是访问 Oracle 的 Java Archive 网站，下载并安装最新的 Java 8 JDK 环境，在撰写本书时是 Java SE 8u121 。请注意，图 [2-1](#Fig1) 中显示的是 Java8u91，因为那是我在 2016 年开发这本书时使用的。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg)图 2-1。Oracle TechNetwork 网站 Java SE 8u91 存档；向下滚动到中间，接受许可协议URL 在图 [2-1](#Fig1) 的地址栏中，或者你可以简单地 Google Java SE 8 JDK 存档下载，它也会给你这个网页的最新链接，我会把它包含在这里， 万一你想剪切粘贴:[http://www . Oracle . com/tech network/Java/javase/downloads/JDK 8-downloads-2133151 . html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)你可以向下拉动网页右侧的滚动条，直到看到 Java SE 开发工具包 8u121 Windows x64 下载链接 长长的版本链接列表中的最后一个链接是 Java SE 8 JDK 开发工具包的最新修订版，因为您想要获得最新的、无错误的、适用于 64 位 Windows 10 操作系统的 Java 8 版本，所以这是您想要的下载。确保使用这个 Java SE 开发套件 8u121 下载链接，不要使用 JRE 下载链接。JRE 是 JDK 8u121 的一部分，因此您不必担心单独获得 Java 运行时。如果您想知道，您确实将使用 JRE 来启动和运行您的 IntelliJ 想法，并且您还将使用 IntelliJ 内部的 JDK 来为 Android 7.x 类使用的 Android 7.x OpenJDK API 提供 Java 8 编程语言基础。注意JRE 是运行 Java 8 或 JavaFX 8 软件的可执行文件(平台)，一旦编译成应用程序，就需要 JRE 来运行 IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3。这是因为 IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3(点三表示版本三)最初是用 Java SE 编码的。确保而不是从 Java 7 下载页面下载 JDK 7u79，因为 Android 7 使用 JavaSE 8u121 和 IntelliJ 2016.3 IDEA，而不是 Java 7 和 NetBeans 7.4 IDE 及其 ADT 插件，所以对于这个基础安装步骤要非常小心。我其实用的是一个完全不同的工作站进行 Android 开发，上面有 Android Studio 2.3 下的 Java SE 8u121 和 IntelliJ 2016.3 IDEA，我还有另外一个 HTML5 和 JavaFX 8 开发工作站，上面安装了 Java SE 8u91 和 NetBeans 8.1。
2.  2。一旦点击接受许可协议单选按钮，您将激活该页面的 Java SE 8 开发套件 8u121 下载部分，如图 [2-1](#Fig1) 所示，在这里您将能够选择您想要使用的操作系统。一旦您单击此下载链接表格左上角的接受许可协议单选按钮，链接将变为粗体，您将能够单击您需要用于 64 位工作站的操作系统版本的链接。
3.  3。点击 Windows x64 链接。这是 64 位版本的 Java for Windows，我正在我的 Windows 10 工作站上使用。如果您使用的是 Linux，请点击“Linux x64”。如果你在 Windows 上，你的操作系统是 64 位的，你会使用 Windows x64 链接；否则，您将使用 Windows x86 链接。要找出您的 Windows 操作系统运行的位深度级别，请打开开始菜单，右键单击计算机选项，并选择属性菜单选项。对于 Windows 10，右键单击开始菜单(Windows)图标，然后选择系统。这将告诉你所有关于你的电脑的硬件，包括它是否使用 32 位或 64 位的 CPU 和操作系统。理想情况下，您的工作站应该使 CPU 的位深度与操作系统的位深度相匹配，我强烈建议使用 64 位操作系统进行 Android 应用程序开发，因为更老的 32 位软件已经过时了近十年。
4.  4。安装可执行文件下载完成后，在工作站硬盘上找到该文件，双击 EXE 文件，在系统上安装 Oracle 的 Java SE 8u121 JDK。
5.  5。接受第二个对话框中的默认设置，如图 [中上图 2-2](#Fig2) ，点击前两个对话框中的下一个按钮，将提取安装。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg)图 2-2。将 Java 8 SE JDK 安装到您的 Android Studio 2.3 软件开发工作站上的六个对话框
6.  6。接受默认的 Java 安装文件夹值，如图 [左下方对话框 2-2](#Fig2) ，标题为目的文件夹。
7.  7 .。Java 安装完成后，如图 [2-2](#Fig2) 中下方对话框所示，使用关闭按钮完成安装，使用控制面板➤程序和功能实用程序确认 JDK 8 在 Android 7.x 开发工作站上安装成功。

Once Java 8u121 (or later) JDK is installed on your workstation, you can then download and install the Android Studio Installer from the tools.android.com website. You can also use that same Add or Remove Programs utility in your Control Panel (that you just used for Java) to remove older Android Studio versions, and to confirm the success of the new Android Studio 2.3 installation, just like you did for your Java SE 8 JDK installation.

## Android Studio:下载并安装 Android Studio 2

Now we need to visit the tools.android.com website, and download and install the Android development environment Android Studio 2.3 zip file from the /download/studio/ folder of the site, located at the following URL :[http://tools.android.com/download/studio/](http://tools.android.com/download/studio/)

1.  1。点击 Android Studio 稳定频道链接，在 Android Studio 项目网站的首页右下方找到。还有一个金丝雀(最新未测试的构建)通道，一个开发者通道(最新内部测试的构建)，一个 Beta 通道(最新 Beta 或外部测试的构建)。我不建议绝对初学者使用这些频道，直到他们成为更高级的用户。
2.  2。这将带你进入顶部带有“ Android Studio 稳定频道”的页面。单击最上面的链接下载最新版本的 Android Studio 2.3.x，然后在文件安装到您的系统后右键单击该文件，并从上下文菜单中选择以管理员身份运行选项。你会看到欢迎来到 Android Studio 对话框，如图 [2-3](#Fig3) 左侧所示。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg)图 2-3。启动 Android Studio 安装程序，点击下一步按钮，选择一个标准安装，点击下一步按钮
3.  3。点击下一步按钮，从图 [2-3](#Fig3) 右侧所示的安装类型对话框中选择标准安装选项，然后再次点击下一步按钮，前进到 Android Studio 验证设置对话框屏幕。
4.  4。如果要查看或更改安装设置，单击上一个按钮；否则点击完成按钮开始安装 Android Studio，如左图 [2-4](#Fig4) 所示。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig4_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig4_HTML.jpg)图 2-4。在验证设置中，查看要安装的 SDK 组件，点击完成开始下载 SDK 组件
5.  5。点击完成后，会出现下载组件对话框，如图 [2-4](#Fig4) 右侧所示，您会看到一个下载… 进度条，带有一个数据字段区域，显示正在下载和安装哪些组件。
6.  6。如果有任何组件无法安装或由于某种原因出现故障，您会看到红色的文字，如图 [2-5](#Fig5) 左侧所示。在我的情况下，我有一个 AMD 八核 CPU，因此英特尔 HAXM 组件将不会安装，因为它需要一个英特尔 CPU 架构。然后我点击了完成按钮，启动了 Android Studio 2.3。由于我写这本书是为了与 Android 7.1.1 (Android 2.3)同时发布，所以我使用 IDE 的预览(beta)版本，以便能够编写这本书来配合稳定版本的发布。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig5_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig5_HTML.jpg)图 2-5。下载完组件，使用配置菜单检查更新，然后管理 SDK
7.  7 .。在欢迎使用 Android Studio 启动界面的下方你会看到一个工具齿轮图标和一个配置下拉菜单，如图 [2-5](#Fig5) 中间所示。选择检查更新，强制 Android Studio 检查其存储库(Android 组件软件服务器数据库)，以便您可以确保您安装了所有最新的 Android SDK 组件版本。
8.  8。要查看 Android Studio 安装由哪些组件组成，第二次下拉此配置菜单，如图右上角 [2-5](#Fig5) ，并选择 SDK 管理器选项。
9.  9。在默认设置对话框中，在外观&行为➤系统设置➤ Android SDK 部分下，在 SDK 平台选项卡中，确保安装了 Android 7.1.1。如图 [2-6](#Fig6) 左侧所示。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig6_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig6_HTML.jpg)图 2-6。SDK 管理器
10.  10。点击 SDK 工具标签，查看 Android Studio 2.3 安装了什么。这在图 [2-6](#Fig6) 的右侧显示。选择谷歌 USB 驱动，你需要用它来操作硬件设备。
11.  11。接下来，点击 SDK Update Sites 选项卡，如图 [2-7](#Fig7) 左侧所示，确保所有的库都已就位，并点击 OK 按钮(如图中的数字 1[2-7](#Fig7))。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig7_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig7_HTML.jpg)图 2-7。安装谷歌 USB 驱动(最新版本)，这样你就可以在真正的安卓硬件设备上测试你的应用了
12.  12。点击确认更改对话框中的确定按钮，如图 [2-7](#Fig7) 中的数字 2 所示，这是因为您选择了将 Google 的 USB 驱动添加为 Android Studio 的组件。
13.  13。在许可协议对话框中，右侧显示图 [2-7](#Fig7) ，点击接受单选按钮，显示为数字 3，接受 Google USB 驱动许可协议。
14.  14。USB 驱动下载安装完毕后，如图 [2-8](#Fig8) ，完成后，点击完成按钮。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig8_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig8_HTML.jpg)图 2-8。谷歌 USB 驱动；在 Android Studio 2.3的组件安装程序对话框中安装请求的组件
15.  15。接下来，让我们回到 SDK 工具标签页，如图 [2-9](#Fig9) 所示，并确保 Google USB 驱动显示为正在安装。这相当于在 Windows 中使用您的程序和功能实用程序。现在，您可以将您的 Android 设备插入您的 Android Studio 工作站，并在真实的 Android 设备上测试您的应用程序，而不是使用缓慢而笨重的 AVD (Android 虚拟设备)仿真器。接下来，点击确定按钮，退出默认设置对话框。![A324674_4_En_2_Fig9_HTML.jpg](A324674_4_En_2_Fig9_HTML.jpg)图 2-9。绝对初学者需要的最低 Android 7.1.1 开发工具现确认安装

Now that we have Android Studio working on your workstation, I’m going to give you a bonus in this chapter, and tell you how to obtain some other professional-level software packages that will help your Android development business to create “front-end” multimedia assets that will set your products apart from the rest of the marketplace because you will add audio, video, imagery, 3D, and 2D SVG Illustration to enhance your user experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design. These are also free for commercial use, making your workstation more valuable.

## 开源新媒体内容软件:UI 和 UX

As you can see in Table [2-1](#Tab1), there are professional software tools for each of the new media asset genres that are supported in Android 7.x. Each of these has been under development for well over a decade, and match all the primary features found in paid multimedia software packages, costing in some cases thousands of dollars each.Table 2-1.New Media Genres supported by Android 7 asset data formats, along with open source software and their URLs

<colgroup><col> <col> <col></colgroup> 
| 新媒体资产类型 | 开源软件包名称 | 下载网址 |

| 办公生产力套件 | Apache(原甲骨文)Open Office 4.1.2 | [](http://www.openoffice.org/) |

I recommend that you go to each of these URLs and download these impressive free multimedia production software packages, because there are no strings attached, and because they give you the capability to make your Android 7.1.1 applications an order of magnitude more desirable, by making them visually (and aurally) superior.

### 新媒体软件:下载和安装工作流程

I’m not going to spend a lot of time going through how to download and install the new media packages because the work process is so similar to what you did during this chapter. Find the download link, find the installer file on your workstation, right-click and run the installer as Administrator, and create a short-cut launch icon on your taskbar. Also, make sure to remove any older versions before you do this, by using the Programs and Features utility.Finally, let’s take a look at powerful new media content production software packages that are almost free, in case you’re intending to create Android new media applications (games, iTV shows, wallpaper, watchfaces, etc.) specifically.

### 读者应该知道的其他负担得起的新媒体软件

There are also some extremely affordable (less than $100 up to $200) new media software packages , which you should take a look at as well, if you are serious about creating impressive new media assets for use in your Android 7.x application development. In the area of 3D, these include:

*   NeverCenter SILO 2.3.1(四边形 3D 建模)
*   哈希动画大师 18(角色动画)
*   灵感时刻 3D 3 (NURBs 3D 建模)
*   TerraGen 4 Pro (3D 虚拟世界生成)
*   六边形 2.5(多边形 3D 建模)
*   Auto-Des-Sys Bonzai (3D 建模，支持所有 3D 建模范例)

In the area of digital imaging, digital video editing, digital illustration. and digital painting, Corel Corporation in Canada offers a large number of software packages under or around $100 that offer an amazing value. Many of these (other than CorelDRAW) were acquired from other software companies, are covered in my Digital Painting Fundamentals and Digital Video Editing Fundamentals (Apress, 2016) titles, and include:

*   Corel Painter 2016(原分形设计画家)
*   Corel PaintShop Pro(如 Photoshop 或 GIMP 3)
*   Corel video studio 终极版
*   CorelCAD 2016
*   CorelDRAW 的多个不同版本(图形 X8、家庭/学生 X7 和技术 X7)

Corel has a number of affordable DVD Authoring and Office Suite solutions as well.There are also other open source packages in the 3D software genre and include:

*   SketchUp(建筑渲染)
*   TerraGen 4 免费版(虚拟世界创作)
*   微软 TrueSpace 8 (3D 动画)
*   Wings 3D (3D 建模)

For audio composition, production, and engineering areas, impressive packages include:

*   适用于 Linux 和 Windows 的玫瑰园(音乐创作、MIDI、乐谱出版)
*   用于 Linux 的 Qtractor(声音设计)

The list of amazing open source software just goes on and on, which is why I took a page or two out of this book to expose you to all of it, as it can make your Android software development workstation at least ten times (known as an “order of magnitude”) more impressive than it would be using only the Android Studio 2.3 IDE, Java SE 8, IntelliJ 2016.3.3 and the OpenJDK.

## 摘要

In this second chapter, you learned about Android Studio and its hardware requirements, and acquired the software that you will need to be able to create your comprehensive Android 7.1.1 application development workstation. I also showed you how to install Android Studio; configure Android Studio; upgrade Android Studio; examine what SDK packages were active in Android Studio; and how to enhance Android Studio with additional Android software development features, such as the ability to test Android applications on a real-world Android device, by connecting it using a USB cable (USB to Micro-USB) in conjunction with Google’s latest USB driver software.From Java SE 8, to Android Studio (IntelliJ), to new media content production software, to business productivity tools, you downloaded and then installed the most impressive open source software packages that can be found anywhere on this planet, adding incredible value to your Android 7.1.1 development workstation with zero monetary outlay. You did this in order to create a foundation for the Android application development work process that we will be undertaking throughout this book; and rather than install these software packages as we go along, I made the decision to get all of our Absolute Beginners readers 100% set up with this amazing software right off the bat!I did this in case you wanted to explore some of the many features of these powerful, exciting new media content production software packages before you actually use them during this book. I think that’s only fair.The best thing about the process was that we accomplished it by using open source, 100% free for commercial usage and professional-level application software packages, which is pretty darned amazing, if you think about it.We started by downloading and installing Oracle’s Java SE 8u121 JDK or Java Development Kit, which is the Java 8 programming language’s SDK. This Java JDK is required to use IntelliJ 2016.3 and Android Studio 2.3, so you can develop application software for Android 7.1.1 OS (and all previous Android versions) for consumer electronic devices.We then visited the Android Developer Tools website, and downloaded and installed Android Studio 2.3, which offers the IntelliJ 2016 IDEA and seamlessly integrates Android 7.1.1 SDK Development Tools on top of IntelliJ and the Java SE 8 JDK and JRE. I also showed you how to get all of the professional new media content development tools that you will want to leverage to create the new media assets used in your Android application, especially if you are targeted graphics-centric HD or UHD iTV set, smartphone, tablet or e-reader device hardware. Lower SD resolution smartwatches will also need to leverage new media visuals to “skin” your users’ smartwatches to make them visually impressive to their friends and family.In the next chapter on how Android and Android Studio works, you will see how these new media assets integrate into Android using XML, and how to create an Android Project using the Android Studio 2.3 software that you just installed during this chapter. This is getting exciting already! Hang on, you’re in for a wild and fun ride!
